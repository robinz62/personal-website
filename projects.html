            <b>Electronic Health Record System for Heart for Africa</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              During our senior year of college, a couple friends and I built a custom EHR for
              nurses working for nonprofit
              <a href="https://www.heartforafrica.org/" target="_blank" class="black-link">Heart for Africa</a>,
              located in Eswatini, Africa. The system would replace paper files, which became
              unwieldy as the number of children being cared for grew to the order of hundreds.
              In July of 2019, three of us hopped on a plane, suitcase equipped with a few
              electronics, to install the system onsite.

              Check out the poster we made for class:

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              On the software side, the product was built as a web application (MERN stack) with
              a nice modern UI. Intended to work with limited resources, in particular very
              unreliable internet access, the server is able to run on a Raspberry Pi right in the
              building. Connected to a router by ethernet, it provides local access from other
              devices (in our case, the nurses had personal laptops). Also, each day, a cron job
              attempts to upload a full backup of the data to the cloud (with highly variable
              success rate).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Despite unreliable internet access and non-static IP of the Pi, through a series of
              complicated connections and procedures we were able to ensure ourselves sporadic
              ssh access into the server, just good enough to allow us to send and install software
              updates and debug any issues.

            <b>Messenger Stats</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              Inspired by the question of just how many thumbs down reacts one of my friends
              received in our beloved group chat, I wrote some scripts to process and visualize
              some potentially interesting stats from Facebook Messenger data.
